            <h4 class="projectNames"><em>NSA PROTOTYPE: SUBTERFUGE</em></h4>
            <p>This was a game I programmed for my COSC 490 class. The goal of the project was to help train new recruits when it came to working with intrusion detection systems. Tasked with the problem of teaching someone to identify unkown DDOS attacks and trojans it was decided to help teach the player how to recognize things that are bad from things that are good. Essentially building up a sixth sense for intrusions. The way the game worked was random "good" and random "bad" objects would fly around a pillar until it reached a sphere in the center called the "data sphere". The player would have to click on all the bad objects to prevent damage to the data sphere while also avoided clicking on good objects. Players had one minute to click on as many bad objects they could without clicking on any bad ones.</p>
            <p>I used only javascript to write all the programming as well as an open source library for splines. If I was to go back and do it again I would have written it in C# since C# is normally better for 3D evironments. I also discovered an issue where I used onMouseUp when I should have used onMouseDown. Because I didn't it made clicking on the objects in the game much harder when they were moving. The major issue I ran into with the creation of this project was the splines. Unity did not have a built in spline pathing and the only other ones out there were either free versions, like the one I used, or one that would cost me forty dollars.</p>
