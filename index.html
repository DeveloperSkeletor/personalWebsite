            <h3><strong>The Purpose of this site</strong></h3>
            <p>I have created this site for my own personal use. I felt it was a good idea to create something involving web development that I am comfortable putting a decent amount of work into it. This website is only going to be used for housing personal projects that I work on, advertisement of myself, and a testing field for any html/css/javascript skills I want to test out. The website currently is pretty much just bones with a bit of skin since it is only utilizing html and css. I plan on adding javascript to the website to make it a bit nicer than it is currently. The main page will normally have something on it that looks out of place because it is the testing field for most of my webpage stuff.</p>
