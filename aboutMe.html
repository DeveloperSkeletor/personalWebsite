            <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
            <p>Patrick Skelly was born in Newark, Deleware and grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. From a young age Patrick always enjoyed video games with Commander Keen being his first game ever. This love for video games started an interest in computers in general. Patrick has always been adept at learning new software quickly and also understands how to build a computer from the ground up. There were very few days where Patrick would not use a computer if he had access to one. By the age of eighteen, Patrick graduated High School and moved to Baltimore, Maryland to start his college career.</p>
            <p>With the major of B.S. in Simulation and Digital Entertainment, a focus of Computer Science, Patrick learned how to extend his software knowledge to help with usablity when creating programs for class assignments. One of the more particular assignments was the creation of a prototype game for the NSA to help new recruits train their brain for intrusion detection. Patrick is also the Vice President of Events for the club "Digital Designers Guild". A club devoted to helping students become proper professionals in their field of interest. The most notable event that the club runs is the "Child's Play Arcade". A week long event where all the proceeds are donated to <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/"><em>Child's Play Charity</em></a>, a charity devoted to donating toys and games to hospitalized children around the world.</p>
            <p>Outside of school and extracuriculars Patrick likes to spend his free time playing games with his friends. He currently finds an interest in cooperative board games like Arkham Horror and Dungeons and Dragons. He also spends much of his free time exercising by swimming and playing volleyball. When he is not with others he spends his time reading fantasy and science fiction books.
