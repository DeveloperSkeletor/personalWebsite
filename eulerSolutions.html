            <h3><strong>Project Euler Solutions</strong></h3>
            <p>In my spare time I like to work on problems from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. I use the website to keep my math skills sharp as well as my problem solving up to par. I use Java to solve all of the problems I take on and use IntelliJ as my compiler.</p>
            <h4>Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</h4>
            <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
            <h4>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers</h4>
            <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
            <h4>Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor</h4>
            <p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p>
            <h4>Problem 4: Largest Palindrom Product</h4>
            <p>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</p>
            <h4>Problem 5: Smallest Multiple</h4>
            <p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p>
